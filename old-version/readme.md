# Cyclum

Cyclum is a package to tackle cell cycle. It provides methods to recover cell cycle information and remove cell cycle factor from the scRNA-seq data. The methodology is to rely on the circular manifold, instead of the marker genes. Multiple methods suits this idea. We provide an Auto-Encoder based realization at this time, and we are adding Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model soon. Also provided are a set of supplementary tools to visualize and anaylzing the result, in python and in R.
